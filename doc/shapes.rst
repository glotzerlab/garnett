Shape Definitions
=================

Shape definitions contain information about the shape of individual particles.
Some shapes define a :code:`type_shape` property, which returns a
:py:class:`dict` for consumption by visualization tools.
The :code:`type_shape` specification can be found here: :doc:`gsd:shapes`.
